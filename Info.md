#### CAGED
Team Project - Unity | 1-month dev cycle
Short Description: It's a game with rhythm we made (not a rhythm game)! Play as a slime and dissolve toilet paper to save your kids!
Details:
Led a team of 6 to build a Unity game from the ground up. I mainly handled the design and implementation of core mechanics like player/enemy movement and attacks, and helped balance the game after playtesting. I also managed our timeline, coordinated the team‚Äôs tasks, and made an ad video to promote it.
put a youtube video here?

<sub>Forever grateful to my incredible teammates, couldn‚Äôt have done it without them!</sub>

#### No Translation!
Team Project ‚Äì Flask + Gemini API | 3-week dev cycle
Short Description: A language learning game forcing you to converse with a chatbot and learn their language?
Details:
Built a chat based language game inspired by Viossa and Linguistic Olympiads, where players reconstruct a target sentence using only contextual clues from a chatbot that speaks exclusively in the target language. I helped with proposing some functions and implemented session storage alongside some core game logic, and debugged user flows to improve the experience.

<sub>Huge thanks to my team, I had fun building this one!</sub>

#### Geoguessr AI Bot
Team Project ‚Äì Vue + Firebase + Gemini API | 3-week dev cycle
Short Description: We like to play Geoguessr, and some people have no friends, so we integrated AI players to play with us.
Details:
Extended an open source GeoGuessr clone by adding a real-time AI bot that competes against human players using Gemini's image analysis. I implemented the API layer that connects the bot's logic with game state, built the interface for adjusting bot count, handled real-time read/write of bot data to Firebase, and integrated bot guesses into the frontend UI and scoreboard.

<sub>This was more tiring than I expected ngl \:')</sub>

#### One2PlayerGame
Team Project ‚Äì Jack (Nand2Tetris) | 2-week dev cycle
Short Description: One2PlayerGame is one two player game, utilizing the restrictions of black and white to create a visually trippy puzzle game.
Details:
We designed and built a cooperative two player puzzle game in the Jack language. I focused on game design, visual elements, object graphics, and level creation, making the most of a strict black and white palette and tile based logic.
