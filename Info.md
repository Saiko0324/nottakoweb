#### CAGED
Team Project - Unity | 1-month dev cycle
Short Description: It's a game with rhythm we made (not a rhythm game)! Play as a slime and dissolve toilet paper to save your kids!
Details:
Led a team of 6 to build a Unity game from the ground up. I mainly handled the design and implementation of core mechanics like player/enemy movement and attacks, and helped balance the game after playtesting. I also managed our timeline, coordinated the team‚Äôs tasks, and made an ad video to promote it.
put a youtube video here?

<sub>Forever grateful to my incredible teammates, couldn‚Äôt have done it without them!</sub>

#### No Translation!
Team Project ‚Äì Flask + Gemini API | 3-week dev cycle
Short Description: A language learning game forcing you to converse with a chatbot and learn their language?
Details:
Built a chat based language game inspired by Viossa and Linguistic Olympiads, where players reconstruct a target sentence using only contextual clues from a chatbot that speaks exclusively in the target language. I helped with proposing some functions and implemented session storage alongside some core game logic, and debugged user flows to improve the experience.

<sub>Huge thanks to my team, I had fun building this one!</sub>

#### Geoguessr AI Bot
Team Project ‚Äì Vue + Firebase + Gemini API | 3-week dev cycle
Short Description: We like to play Geoguessr, and some people have no friends, so we integrated AI players to play with us.
Details:
Extended an open source GeoGuessr clone by adding a real-time AI bot that competes against human players using Gemini's image analysis. I implemented the API layer that connects the bot's logic with game state, built the interface for adjusting bot count, handled real-time read/write of bot data to Firebase, and integrated bot guesses into the frontend UI and scoreboard.

<sub>This was more tiring than I expected ngl \:')</sub>

#### One2PlayerGame
Team Project ‚Äì Jack (Nand2Tetris) | 2-week dev cycle
Short Description: One2PlayerGame is one two player game, utilizing the restrictions of black and white to create a visually trippy puzzle game.
Details:
We designed and built a cooperative two player puzzle game in the Jack language. I focused on game design, visual elements, object graphics, and level creation, making the most of a strict black and white palette and tile based logic.

<sub>This was my first ever game project, and I'm thinking of making a new rendition \:D</sub>

### <font color="orange">Web</font>
#### This website
Solo Project ‚Äì Vue + Tailwind(?) | Summer 2025
Short Description:A passion project built to house my work, experiments, and the occasional strange ideas.
Details:
Built the frontend from scratch with a focus on responsiveness and modular design. Visuals were designed by <font color="cyan">PJyun</font>, and I coded it all out by hand.
It‚Äôs static for now, but I‚Äôm planning to hook it up with a backend in the future.

### <font color="orange">Bonus: Writing</font>
Solo Work ‚Äì Narrative Writing | Collaboration Project
Short Description:
Wrote the story and treatment for a short film centered on the internal experiences of depression.
Details:

## Links
I don't have much for now, and I'm questioning whether to put my instagram here or not, since it's a private account and I don't feel comfortable sharing that information with just anyone.
For now I'm planning for it to be just GitHub and Linkedin.

## Resume
Since this website is still somewhat meant to be a portfolio, I figured I'll put my resume(s) here for anyone interested. I make different versions tailored to specific fields:

### <font color="orange">Web Development</font>
Currently focusing on frontend development, design systems, and responsive UI work, but do have a pretty solid understanding of full-stack development. Comfortable with working across the stack and learning backend APIs, databases, and server-side tools as needed.

### <font color="orange">Game Development</font>
I've always liked offbeat or unconventional gameplay, and pairing that with wanting to create games, I mainly focus on designing the core game mechanics, the interaction loops, and the balance that makes things just frustrating enough to be fun. I'd say coming up with surreal or weird systems and player experience had always been my forte, just don‚Äôt ask me to make your game look or sound good (I will cry). I work best when paired with other talented visual and audio people who can bring the rest of the world to life.

### <font color="orange">Systems/Engineering</font>
I (kind of) like systems programming, currently learning on Linux kernel internals, memory management, and virtualization (QEMU/KVM). I‚Äôm particularly interested in systems security ‚Äî isolating processes, locking down memory, and breaking things just to put them back together safer. I‚Äôve also worked on embedded platforms (BLE, RTOS, etc.); not my favorite domain, but I know my way around it when needed.

### <font color="orange">Template</font>
My resumes are made from overleaf templates, but if you're lazy like me, and want to copy someone else's format to put in your information, here's [my template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jvjmzjjkvpbn#785d62).
Just copy the entire thing into your own overleaf project and put in your own information, best of luck job seeking!

### <font color="orange">Other Interests</font>
Some stuff I hadn't worked with or done professionally (yet), but like poking at anyway. Had my fair share of courses in AI/ML, web security, and encryption, mostly because ignoring them feels impossible. Software design‚Äôs on the list as well so I can fake knowing what‚Äôs going on. Probably don't have enough passion to start my own projects around any of these (but if it's a game though?), just drifting through ideas until something sticks or I lose interest.

## Contact
Currently open to job offers or project work, assuming it doesn‚Äôt make me miserable.
