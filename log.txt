I deployed two games (Geoguessr & No Translation) on accessible websites to better introduce my work.
There's so much to do I honestly don't know what should be my next step.

13/07/2025
I finisheed the complete design style revamp, had an idea of putting all the controllables in a settings navigation.
For easier compatibility, mobile usage design remains the same, and certain functionalities will be omitted for my sanity.

12/07/2025
Revamped the Art design and fixed some RWD issues I found.

11/07/2025
Took me a two more days but I finished the current topics (removed others and resume for now), might change that Art section later.
I'll start working on revamping the design tomorrow. Damn I really don't know what to put in links.

Took another week long break, I have a clear picture of what I want/need now, just need time and effort to implement them.
Currently being a lil bit troubled about how I can credit others from the works section. Probably just going to directly ask each one of them.
Completed the subwindow and Works section. Might come back to work of the readability in the future since I find the colors slightly distracting.
Also I might remove the Others section purely because I'm kinda lazy to write them in detail.

02/07/2025
Took a long break from the project to think about what I want it to be.
Gonna start changing up the looks and putting the info in, it's gonna be a long process.
I finished About.
Side note: didn't get the job, . On the bright side I have more time to work on this now (I guess?).

27/06/2025
Had a long discussion with my girlfriend about the visuals and she'll be the one designing them.
Finished typing out all the needed informations, most of them need to wait for format design before putting them in place.
I'll work on new window viewer designs and the About.vue format first.

26/6/2025
Slight modification to directory structure, moved the main menu information components to a separate directory.
All info components' window sizes that can be modified individually, though they are all empty for now, but its a start.
Had a lot of thought about the designs and how to present the menu list, but felt tired today for implementation.
Wrote info.md for other sections to better organize the information I want to present, might be easier to design their respective format this way as well.
Hopefully tomorrow I can start putting the other info in place and format them.
Side note: Had an interview for a job today, pretty confident about it, but that also means I have less time to work on this project for the rest of summer break, so much to do with so little time :(

Fixed a bunch of responsive designs, made a new info window viewer for mobile, integrate drag feature into screen touch using pointer events.
Customizing format for About info in mobile view. Will work on other info next, if I get tired I'll do other things like allowing user to customize the floating takodachi.
I should really find an easier way to migrate info to mobile instead of manually formatting it, but I'm too tired to learn how, and too excited to see the results immediately at the same time.
I might also start working on the light/dark mode toggle to force myself to lear TailwindCSS, since I've read that it's quite convenient with it, and I can learn to implement global buttons for future use as well.

24/06/2025
Made a lot of changes to previous things because they get messed up on zoom in, mostly on sizes to make them more responsive.
Also made some changes to the main menu list and the draggable window component to show more visual cue.
Making the About.vue is difficult for me, as I've actually had to learn to use CSS for pretty much the first time in this project.
Damn, I really need to work on my visual design skills, but I think this is a good start.
Nonetheless, I made some progress on it, and I think making the rest of the info will be faster with this learning experience.

23/06/2025
Tested new fonts and decided on them, made a main menu to display the topics, and containers that simulate a window to put the contents within.
Fixed bugs between background and main menu pointer events. Made a few tweaks to enchance visual clarity.
Will work on the content info next.

22/06/2025
Went outside to touch grass and didn't feel like development today, so I wrote a basic structure of what I want to show on the website.
Also changed up the color design a bit and put in some fonts.
I'll work on presenting the main topics and the containers for the sub-topics next.

21/06/2025
Updated scrolling banner to use WebP format instead (sprite animator unused lmao), also finished background with takodachi floating around.
There are three types currently, might add more later, and they are draggable.
Next is either light/dark mode or writing the actual informations.

20/06/2025
Made a scrolling banner that randomly generates takodachi to stroll through the top, sources are from the web and my lovely girlfriend.
Next up I wanna work on more floaty things in the background, postponing the actual information presentaions because this is more fun lmao.

19/06/2025
Migrated the project into Vite for future development, mainly for component segregation.

18/06/2025
Didn't do any implementation, but I finished a basic crash course about HTML and CSS, and looked into other stuff like Tailwind CSS.
Also brainstormed some more ideas I wanted to implement, but my next step would be a simple landing page.

17/06/2025
I implemented the basic holy triangle to get myself going and wrote some stuff in the README.md file.
I wanted this log to exist so I can keep myself in check to keep working on this project, might make it visible on the page in the future.

16/06/2025
I learned a bit about web dev things, created a repo with some basic files and officially started this project.
The website is hosted on GitHub and that's about it.
