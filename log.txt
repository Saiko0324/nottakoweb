Updated scrolling banner to use WebP format instead (sprite animator unused lmao), also finished background with takodachi floating around.
There are three types currently, might add more later.
Next is either light/dark mode or writing the actual informations.

Made a scrolling banner that randomly generates takodachi to stroll through the top, sources are from the web and my lovely girlfriend.
Next up I wanna work on more floaty things in the background, postponing the actual information presentaions because this is more fun lmao.

Migrated the project into Vite for future development, mainly for component segregation.

Didn't do any implementation, but I finished a basic crash course about HTML and CSS, and looked into other stuff like Tailwind CSS.
Also brainstormed some more ideas I wanted to implement, but my next step would be a simple landing page.

I implemented the basic holy triangle to get myself going and wrote some stuff in the README.md file.
I wanted this log to exist so I can keep myself in check to keep working on this project, might make it visible on the page in the future.

I learned a bit about web dev things, created a repo with some basic files and officially started this project.
The website is hosted on GitHub and that's about it.
