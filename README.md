## Introduction
I've always wanted to make my own website and serve it as a portfolio, as well as a platform to implement some of my weird ideas. This idea had been put off for far too long due to me not knowing how to do css/visual things, but I can learn, and **I'm tired of waiting for when I have time**. Hence this summer (June 2025) I'm actually going to start.

## Publicity
### Difficulty Starting
Personally, I've struggled to start a lot of things due to self imagining the difficulty curve when seeing someone else's complete projects, so I figured I'd make my progress public. And if you are like me, always discouraged by other people's amazing projects, take a look at my journey and hopefully my idiotic trial and error motivates you to start yours.

### Potential Privatization
If the day ever comes that I make something I don't want to share the code for, I'll create a seperate repo and make two versions of this website instead.

### Motivational Speech
To my future self, or you that's reading this for whatever ungodly reason, **please make anything**, keep creating and keep materializing your thoughts and ideas, a bad project is infinitely better than nothing. The first step to making anything cool is to make something, and if its bad make it better.

## Tech Stack
Currently nothing besides vue (planned), I want to start with basic html, css and javascript to consolidate my fundamentals.

## Ideas
1. quote generator to put in the dumbass things I say
2. some nice/beautiful/rare words to learn
3. button clicker game?
4. light/dark mode, but this requires visual stuff so I might postpone it :\(
5. some bug crawly thing from [this cool video](https://youtu.be/Q_-Veut_EJ4?list=LL&t=4)
6. implement multiple imbedded windows and integrate some variation of [this thing](https://github.com/bgstaal/multipleWindow3dScene) (not the 3d part though)
7. some form of grid based game/avatar movement (web embedded character control)
