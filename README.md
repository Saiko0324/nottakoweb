## Inspiration
### Sharlene Yap
She has been one of the biggest inspirations, I saw a video on her youtube and had been obsessed with this website idea ever since. Here's [her website](https://www.sharyap.com/), and [her video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tWh4cYCTv0). If the style of my website looks similar it's because she's a direct influence. And Shar, if you happen to read this, please don't hesitate if you find the designs too similar and want me to change them, and say hi to froggert for me \:D

### Nathan Tokyo
Chef's kiss for his interactive design, makes me want to do cool things as well. The product speaks for themselves so please [check out his page](https://nathan.tokyo/)

## Introduction
I've always wanted to make my own website and serve it as a portfolio, as well as a platform to implement some of my weird ideas. This idea had been put off for far too long due to me not knowing how to do css/visual things, but I can learn, and **I'm tired of waiting for when I have time**. Hence this summer (June 2025) I'm actually going to start.

## Publicity
### Difficulty Starting
Personally, I've struggled to start a lot of things due to self imagining the difficulty curve when seeing someone else's complete projects, so I figured I'd make my progress public. And if you are like me, always discouraged by other people's amazing projects, take a look at my journey and hopefully my idiotic trial and error motivates you to start yours.

### Potential Privatization
If the day ever comes that I make something I don't want to share the code for, I'll create a seperate repo and make two versions of this website instead.

### Motivational Speech
To my future self, or you that's reading this for whatever ungodly reason, **please make anything**, keep creating and keep materializing your thoughts and ideas, a bad project is infinitely better than nothing. The first step to making anything cool is to make something, and if its bad make it better.

## Tech Stack
Vue framework with tailwindcss (integrated but not used yet), initially I wanted to start with basic html, css and javascript to consolidate my fundamentals, but figured I could learn the skills simultaneously (I think).

## Ideas (not in order)
1. quote generator to put in the dumbass things I say
2. some nice/beautiful/rare words to learn
3. button clicker game?
4. light/dark mode, but this requires visual stuff so I might postpone it :\(
5. some bug crawly thing from [this cool video](https://youtu.be/Q_-Veut_EJ4?list=LL&t=4)
6. implement multiple imbedded windows and integrate some variation of [this thing](https://github.com/bgstaal/multipleWindow3dScene) (not the 3d part though)
7. some form of grid based game/avatar movement (web embedded character control)
   1. a controller that moves the screen
   2. another controller that moves the character
8. parry based rhythmn game
9.  message visualizer to show my log.txt
10. keyboard input checker
11. input some letters and render them with gravity
12. Colour blind mode and rgb mode
13. Dyslexie font (never mind it costs money, so fuck that)
14. customize takodachi speed?
15. beta art version
16. minimize windows/subwindows

## Notes to self
1. bilingual texts with vue-i18n
2. lets encrypt to have https
3. porkbun for a domain name to host
4. convert png to webp for better download utilization
5. responsive design with @media screen and (max-width:n px)
6. use [checklist](https://www.checklist.design/) and [webaim](https://webaim.org/) to check accessibility
7. for mobile compatibility, use `calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * n);` instead of `vh` (disregard nav bar)
8. properly set up GitHub and Linkedin for viewing lmao
9. make your goddamn resumes ==
10. ask teammates how/would they prefer to be credited
11. free sound effects at https://www.zapsplat.com/
12. someone told me to mention licensing, I'll do it when I feel like it I guess
